# Kywoo3d Mods - Firmware mirror

Mirrors the official firmware source code, in an easy way.

## History

The v1 firmware is a fork of: https://github.com/makerbase-mks/Mks-Robin-Nano-Marlin2.0-Firmware
Specifically from commit https://github.com/makerbase-mks/Mks-Robin-Nano-Marlin2.0-Firmware/commit/7d256c6d8a2b4a727f881ccdf48852e271d9fe60

For v2 firmware, Kywoo3D seems to have upgraded to a newer Marlin 2.0.9 base and modified the UI.

## Structure

The `main` branch is to keep tools/docs that help maintain this mirror.
